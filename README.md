Patterns
========

Patterns is just a collection (or will be) of procedural pattern generators
that share a common abstract base class. The base class GPattern allows extending
classes to hide most of their non-generic content internally, and share a common 
constructor signature.

Unique parameters are initialized and set after pattern classes are constructed.

Patterns was written in Processing v2.0b8
